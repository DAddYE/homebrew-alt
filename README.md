How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap DAddYE/alt` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install DAddYE/alt/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```sh
$ brew install https://raw.github.com/DAddYE/homebrew-alt/master/<formula>.rb
```

Docs

`brew help`, `man brew`, or the Homebrew [wiki][].
