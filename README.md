## DAddYE Homebrew

###Â How do I install these formulae?

Just `brew tap DAddYE/homebrew` and then `brew install daddye/<formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install DAddYE/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```sh
$ brew install https://raw.github.com/DAddYE/homebrew/master/<formula>.rb
```
